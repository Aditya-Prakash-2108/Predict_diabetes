# Predict_diabetes using KNN
In the project, a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model was developed to predict whether a person has diabetes. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% and an F1 score of 0.70.

The accuracy of 81% indicates that the model correctly predicted the presence or absence of diabetes for 81% of the instances in the test set. This suggests that the model performs reasonably well in classifying individuals into the correct categories.

The F1 score of 0.70 provides additional insight into the model's performance. The F1 score is a metric that combines precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's accuracy. A score of 0.70 indicates a decent balance between precision (ability to identify true positives) and recall (ability to capture all actual positives) for the classification task.

It is important to note that the interpretation of the accuracy and F1 score depends on the specific context and requirements of the project. Therefore, further analysis and consideration of the domain-specific factors are essential to fully assess the significance of the achieved performance.

Overall, the project successfully implemented a KNN model to predict the presence of diabetes, achieving a satisfactory level of accuracy and F1 score. These results provide a solid foundation for further analysis and potential improvements to enhance the model's performance.
